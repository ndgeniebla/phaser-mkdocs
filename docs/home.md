#Introduction

Hello and Welcome to PhaserFirst! By following this documentation, you will learn how to create a small [Phaser][1] project and kick off your game developement journey. Throughout the document we will guide you step by step towards creating a simple version of the classic video game Pong with the goal of understanding the fundamentals of what makes up a Phaser project.
